        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "- A RESTful API is a web API that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) to let clients and servers communicate over HTTP in a simple, standardized way. In practice, you use URLs to represent resources and HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to work with those resource .\n",
        "2. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "- Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that makes it easy to build web applications and APIs. It is called a “microframework” because it provides the essentials (routing, request/response handling, templates) without enforcing a specific database, authentication system, or project structure.\n",
        "3. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "- GET\n",
        "    - Used to fetch/read data from the server without changing anything on the server .\n",
        "- POST\n",
        "    - Used to create new data (a new resource) on the server.\n",
        "- PUT\n",
        "    - Used to completely update or replace an existing resource on the server.\n",
        "- DELETE\n",
        "    - Used to remove an existing resource from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "- The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to bind a URL endpoint to a Python function. When a user visits that URL, Flask executes the associated function and returns its result as an HTTP response .  \n",
        "5. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "- Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that simplifies database operations by providing an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). It allows you to interact with databases using Python classes and objects, making it easier to perform CRUD operations without writing raw SQL .\n",
        "6. How do you create a basic Flask application?\n",
        "- To create a basic Flask app:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Import Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create an app instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define a route and a view function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Run the app.\n",
        "7. How do you return JSON responses in Flask?\n",
        "- from flask import jsonify\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/data')\n",
        "def get_data():\n",
        "    return jsonify({'key': 'value'})\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "- from flask import request\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "def submit():\n",
        "    data = request.form['key']\n",
        "    return f'Received: {data}'\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask (e.g., 404)?\n",
        "- @app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "def page_not_found(error):\n",
        "    return 'Page not found', 404\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you structure a Flask app using Blueprints?\n",
        "- Blueprints help organize large Flask applications by splitting routes and logic into separate modules:\n",
        "\n",
        "Create a Blueprint instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Define routes within the Blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "Register the Blueprint with the app.\n"
